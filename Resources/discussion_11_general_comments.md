	When, if ever, is cheating acceptable in video games?

1. Clear definitions of cheating are needed.  It is really not clear that a behaviour counts as cheating if everyone knows about it and is ok with it.  That doesn't seem like cheating, that seems like "just part of the way we play the game."  You're welcome to call this cheating but to do so you'll need to argue for why/how it still counts as cheating given that it looks like a sanctioned rule change.
2. Some of you are also throwing around "fairness" and saying things like "unfair cheating is not ok".  This implies that "fair cheating" is ok.  I'm not sure what fair cheating is or if it is ok because these drafts are silent about it beyond the implication that such a thing exists.
3. Many of you need to consider the degree to which cheating can harm a person in a single player game, possibly by robbing them of a sense of accomplishment or real skill development.  This might be a small thing but it is more that "no harm".  Also note a psychological effect sometimes referred to as "buyer's remorse";  just because you want something now doesn't mean that you'll be happy when you get it.  So, it seems possible that a present-self can harm a future-self.
4. This should be an _easy topic_ to put pictures in.
5. It seems that more than a few of you would benefit from reading [_The Grasshopper_, Ch. 4](https://www.library.ualberta.ca/catalog/7346442), since it would clear up the confusion between spoilsports and cheaters.  It's short.
6. Interesting that so many of you state that when money is on the line that cheating becomes unacceptable.  What is it that gives money this property and why is it not extended to play that does not have financial stakes?  What happened to honour?
7. Specific examples, those that name particular games and outline the particular cheats done, should be used over general comments like "people cheat in action games by breaking the rules".
8. Please stop saying things like "someone might say..." No.  Find someone who actually thinks/says it and quote them.  If you don't do this you are in danger of arguing against a point that isn't really a point.
9. Using cheat codes and walkthroughs too often can hurt a player's experience as well.  What many of you are likely after is optimal flow.  See [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) and this accompanying image:

	After making an assessment of the research on both sides of the divide and while keeping your eye on the complications of the real world, what advice should be offered to parents wondering about how they should raise their children in a world that surrounds them with video games?

1. Specific games that hit the points you are highlighting should be included.  Should they be playing WoW, GTA, Space Invaders, King's Quest, what?
2. Avoid generic advice (e.g. "spend time playing games with your kids") unless you can back it up with research (ideally) or expert opinion (secondarily).  Specifics like "no more than X hours a day and here's why..." or "Games of type X (eg W, Y, Z) are to be avoided and here's why..." should be in all these papers.
3. You should have little trouble finding all sorts of advice or opinion about how people should be raising their kids regarding video games.  Look.  Then assess and decide.
4. Some scepticism about ESRB ratings is likely warranted.  At the very least these ratings will be influenced by the industry with pressure to soften theme.  A similar effect has happened in the movie industry, called ["rating creep"](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/14/movies/study-finds-film-ratings-are-growing-more-lenient.html?_r=0).  Scepticism is also warranted where the Entertainment Software Association is concerned since they represent the companies in the industry.
5. If you want some controversy around the violence in games and the consequences there of then see this [APA report from 2015](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/violent-video-games.aspx) and the [open letter sent when the task force was commissioned two years earlier](https://www.scribd.com/doc/223284732/Scholar-s-Open-Letter-to-the-APA-Task-Force-On-Violent-Media-Opposing-APA-Policy-Statements-on-Violent-Media).
6. This is another topic where including images in non-trivial ways should be easy.
