	Can there be a feminist war game?  If you think there can then you need to make sure that your answer does three things:

		1. Proves this to be the case by outlining such a game.
		2. Tying together that outline to the goals of modern, third-wave, feminism as outlined in class.
		3. Defending your example against claims that it might _look_ like a feminist war game but in reality it is something else (e.g. a regular war game or not a war game at all), meaning that you are going to need to be very clear on what makes a war game in the future and how yours is different.

		If you think that there cannot be such a war game then there is really only one path open to you:  Argue from the definitions and principles involved that a feminist war game would be a contradiction and is thus impossible.

		In either case you should also consider the practicalities of developing and deploying such a game (e.g. could it be popular? would it necessarily be expensive?) but do not let these considerations distract you from the core question, which is whether or not a feminist war game is possible.

1.  Some of you are carving out a space that says something like, "We can add components to war games that are more respectful of women (and others, do not forget the other groups), _but_ a fully feminist war game is not possible due to conflicting values."  If this is your point then make sure that you make it clear what the best that can be done in the war game genre is with such changes.
2.  There really should be _something_ about social groups, feminism in general, and _why_ this question matters beyond being of possible theoretical interest.  In short, why should the gaming industry and people in general, gamers or not, care about this question.
3.  You may find it valuable to catch up on what Gamergate is about.  You can do this from Wikipedia but [this article from _The Guardian_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/14/the-only-guide-to-gamergate-you-will-ever-need-to-read/?utm_term=.4b0a5a2e1e72) might give you a better summarized time line.  If you'd like a look at the sort of article that is part of the Gamergate backlash then [look here](http://www.returnofkings.com/46346/gamergate-why-feminists-want-to-destroy-gaming) or [here](http://www.antifeministtech.info/category/gaming/).  If you need to read what Sarkeesian is about then have a [look at this article](http://kotaku.com/how-anita-sarkeesian-wants-video-games-to-change-1688231729).  If you need a sense of the volume of content that is out there about this topic then throw out a few Google searches with "Sarkeesian" as one of the search terms.
4.  Keep in mind that you are focused on the possibility of a single, feminist war game existing or not.  Get this task out of the way before taking on the issues within the gaming industry that this points to.
5.  Think about who the gaming industry is made up of.  I've seen at least three answers so far that are running on the assumption that it is all about twenty-something males playing FPS games.  This is just one segment.  In the future it will likely be even a smaller segment than it is today as games change and diversify and people change and diversify.  If you want some industry snap-shot numbers then you can find the ones I used in the "Consequences of Playing Video Games" lecture in the "Introduction to Topic 4" [on our GitHub page](https://github.com/symulation/UofA-PHIL366-F16).
6.  Look at Saklofske's Slide 30.
7.  If you're going to invoke the "video games are supposed to be fun" argument the take into account Saklofske, Slide 37.  He's being a little tongue in cheek here, but only partly.
8.  Seriously, just read his whole talk.  I'm pretty sure about 50% of the answers I've seen haven't...
