	When, if ever, is it ok to use known to be addictive techniques when designing a game?  In your answer take into account what Bogost has to say about exploitationware and gamification.

1. You're likely going to want to explore what a game is.  You should be able to consider at least two definitions and choose between them as an easy way to begin boosting the critical aspect of your writing.
2. I'm seeing the "people can choose to play the game or not" coming up in various ways in the arguments.  Keep in mind that while this seems straightforward on the surface that it is really much more complicated.  People don't choose to be addicted, it's not as though the choice is made at the beginnig with full knowledge of the consequences.  So, when it comes to choosing to play games that are addictive it is not so simple as saying, "people can choose for themselves".  Yes, people can and do choose for themselves but this is not the same as saying such choices were made with full knowledge and a clear mind.
3. There are games that are already heavily regulated, gambling games.  These games can lead people to financial ruin and that is usually the reason given for regulation.  Are video games importantly different?
4. So far I haven't seen any drafts that talk about what the actual addictive techniques are.  This is _really_ important to include because without it you'll just end up gesturing at generalities.
5. Get an example or two of _actual people_ who have video game addiction problems and then consider them in the response to the question.
6. Think about the revenue streams that used to exist for games (really just the purchase of the game itself) and the new revenue streams that exist for games through models like, free-to-play, DLC, episodes, etc.
7. Spend some time considering just how strong the potentially addicttive qualities of games are.
8. Willpower alone is not enough to overcome addiction.  Do some poking around and you'll see this come up again and again _when your sources are people who work with/research people with addictions_.  Be careful, there is a lot of non-expert opinion out there that amounts to "If you want it hard enough you'll get better."   I suspect that part of this problem is that exactly what counts as addiction or addiction promoting mechanics are unclear because this hasn't been looked up.
9. Be very clear about what Bogost says that gamification is.  It is not what about half of those who have written on this topic seem to think he thinks it is.  Look at the section "Gamification is the goal of gamification" for a crash course and note that he is ok with points and badges and the like.  His problem is with the process via which they are often introduced or deployed.
10. Note everything that counts as "gamification" is necessarily an addictive technique.
