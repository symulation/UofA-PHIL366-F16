#Philosophy 366 – PRACTICE Final Exam, Fall 2016	Instructor: Simpson, J.














##This isn’t really a practice final exam since the sections are really just collections of questions of the sort and on topics that you can expect to see on the final exam and so all the questions together create an exam that is much longer than you will actually see.  Some of the questions are left over from previous instances of this course and may not apply to this one.  In the case of the short answer questions all the questions are from a previous exam and so may or may not be representative of the content you will see while being entirely representative of the sorts of questions you can expect to be asked in this section.

##All this aside, you should find this informative.

###Essays (2 questions, 40 points each)
In answering each of the questions below you will be expected to do four things.

1. Make connections between the readings used throughout the course. 
2. Make an argument for a position and against the important alternatives.
3. Draw on material from outside the readings, including class discussions and material from your own investigations.
4. Demonstrate the extent to which you understand the themes and arguments made within the course by carrying out numbers 1, 2, and 3.

Even if a question does not specifically ask you for a specific number of readings you should be leveraging the text extensively.

Note that “making an argument” within this context requires you to correctly identify and describe at least one view that opposes your position.  Go beyond simply summarizing these alternative views and make it clear how you think that their strengths and weaknesses play out against those of your own position.  Avoid choosing weak opposing positions as this will lower the quality of your answer.

You are not be required to cite ideas directly in a formal way during this exam—regardless, you must make it clear when you are using ideas from the text and to whom they belong (e.g. According to McLuhan...). The exception to this amnesty are direct quotes drawn from the texts you are allowed to bring into the exam. If using these then simply write the last name of the original speaker followed by the page number of the text where the quote may be found.

1. Is it possible to escape the maelstrom of technological control or not?  If so, then how can it be done and who is capable of this?  If not then why not? Choose four authors from the term and, making it clear how they relate to this topic, incorporate them into your answer.

2. What is the “Turing Test”? What was its importance/relevance? Drawing on at least three articles from the course, make an argument for what its current importance is (if anything) and defend this against the strongest alternative. 

3. What are the predicted consequences of augmenting humans and human control with machines and machine control? Make sure that you draw on at least three readings from across the entire term and our in-class discussions.

4. What does Haraway mean when she says that we are moving, “...from all work to all play, a deadly game?”  Compare this answer to approaches to the consequences of technology raised by at least two other authors looked at this term and argue whether or not Haraway and these other authors are right.

5. Fuchs uses critical theory to explore the role of social media today.  Summarize two of his arguments and then draw in two other authors from the term while assessing the success/importance of Fuchs arguments.

6. Drawing on X sources from across the entire term argue for or against one of the following claims:
	a. Video games should have a significant role to play in both formal and informal education.
	b. Social media has made important changes in how we organize ourselves and communicate.
	c. Computers have made a significant impact, perhaps the most significant of all technology, on our culture.
