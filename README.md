# Philosophy 366, A2 - Fall 2016
## Computers & Culture


Welcome to _Computers & Culture_.  We'll be using this GitHub project to collect together almost everything of relevance to the class.  This will not be a static project nor page for the duration of this class so you'll want to check back regularly each week since updates will not be pushed to you.

### Topic Summary

#### Topic #1 - Introduction to Core Concepts

##### September 

**2 - First Class.**  The first class will feature only a quick review of the mechanics of the class since the details are all in the syllabus and then move into a review of foundational concepts and authors related to the rise of computers both in and of themselves and as machines that both shape and are shaped by culture.  This first class will focus less on authors and more on general concepts, questions, and ideas of relevance.

**5 - Labour Day, University Holiday, No Class.**

**7 - Community Service-Learning Introduction.**  This class has an optional CSL component.  A representative from this program will be in class to make a short presentation and answer questions.  We will continue the introduction begun on the first day of class, shifting focus to look at particular authors.  Contributions by [Vannevar Bush]((http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)) and [Douglas Englebart](http://www.dougengelbart.org/firsts/dougs-1968-demo.html) are the likely foci of the class.

**9 - Visit to EPL Makerspace.**  *All* students in the class are expected to meet the instructor inside the Makerspace at the Stanley Milner Branch of the Edmonton Public Library at 1pm.  The visit will last until 1:50pm.  Students who are not able to join the class at this time will be expected to make arrangements with the EPL Makerspace for a tour at a mutually convenient time.

**12 - Continuing the Introduction.**  We will carry over the introduction from the 2nd and 7th by looking at important writing from [Alan Turing](http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html) and [Ted Nelson](http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-21-nelson.pdf).

**14 - Concluding the Introduction.**  We will conclude the introduction from the previous classes by looking at the ideas of [H. Marshal McLuhan (just Chapter 1)](http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/eds/detail/detail?sid=642e8320-f34d-4c07-b924-f35e5f3c0a9f%40sessionmgr107&vid=0&hid=108&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#) and [Donna Haraway](http://cast.b-ap.net/arc590s14/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2014/03/haraway.pdf).

#### Topic #2 - Computer Programming in Formal Educational Systems

**16 - Introduction to Topic.** Today we'll look at the current state of computer programming education in K-12 schools, using articles from[CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/back-to-school-canada-lagging-in-push-to-teach-kids-computer-coding-1.3185926) and [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/20/google-gallup-poll-finds-parents-want-computer-science-education-but-administrators-arent-sure/31991889/) as our jumping off point. 

**19 - _Should computer programming be taught as part of early education?_** That there is demand for computer programming to be taught it schools should be clear, but we shouldn't do things just because they are in demand.  We'll take seriously the question of whether computer programming should be taught is schools by building on the content from the previous class and adding the voices of [Guzdial] (http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/173870-the-danger-of-requiring-computer-science-in-k-12-schools/fulltext), [Duckett/Abbott](http://www.zdnet.com/article/unless-kids-are-working-coding-should-not-be-taught-abbott/), and [Bajarin](http://time.com/2881453/programming-in-schools/).  We will also spend some time prepping for our first all discussion class (next class) by going over the criteria for good discussion questions and developing questions to be used next day.  Keep in mind that these questions will form the basis of writing assignments.

**21 - Discussion.**

**23 - _How have people thought about teaching coding historically?_**  While not a good question for discussion in its own right this question will lead us to look into the past and in doing so discover questions of both relevance to the main topic and of interest to this particular class.  We'll be drawing directly on the work of [Papert, (Pages 19-37 and 78-93 from _Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas_)](http://dl.acm.org.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/citation.cfm?id=1095592), [Kay and Goldberg](http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-26-kay.pdf), and returning to look at [Nelson (pay close attention to "No More Teacher's Dirty Looks")]((http://www.newmediareader.com/book_samples/nmr-21-nelson.pdf)) again. 

**26 - Discussion.**

**28 - Coding vs Training?** One of the "Don't teach kids to code!" responses sees coding as the past and insists on looking to the future: training.  _Wired_ magazine has been pushing this idea a lot with articles from [Sehringer](http://www.wired.com/insights/2015/02/should-we-really-try-to-teach-everyone-to-code/), [Tanz ("The End of Code" was the June 2015 cover story)](http://www.wired.com/2016/05/the-end-of-code/), and [Metz](http://www.wired.com/2016/05/google-alpha-go-ai/).  We'll start poking at this idea to see what life is in it and select the subtopic to conclude this topic as a whole with.

**30 - Discussion.**

##### October

**3 - Class selected subtopic, TBD.**  Each of the major topics will conclude with a class selected subtopic that will be chosen, in-class, two classes prior.

**5 - Discussion.** 

**7 - Review.**  We will clean-up any lingering questions or ideas related to teaching programming/coding in schools, including making sure that we have solid understandings of strong responses to the questions raised during the discussions.

**10 - Thanksgiving Day, University Holiday, No Class.**

#### Topic #3 - Impacts of Social Media

##### October

**12 - Introduction, Part 1.** We lay a foundation for critically examining social media with a crash course in Marxism and some historical communication/media theorists, specifically pieces by [Hans Magnus Enzensberger](https://newleftreview-org.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/I/64/hans-magnus-enzensberger-constituents-of-a-theory-of-the-media) and [Jean Baudrillard](https://mediosyhumanidades.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/requiem-for-the-media_baudrillard.pdf).

**14 - Introduction, Part 2.**  With some historical background and Marxist foundations laid down we turn to the only full text we will be using this term, Christian Fuchs' _Social Media: A Critical Introduction_.  We'll be looking at the first four chapters (80 pages of reading) so make sure that you've looked at it well in advance.

**17 - Economics and Production.**  We'll look at Chapters 5 & 10 today, looking at some of the core economics that seems to be driving social media sites.

**19 - Discussion.**

**21 - Good, Evil, and Blowing the Whistle.**  Chapters 6 & 9 will frame an investigation into the ideology (the framework of perceptions/ideas through which our experiences are filtered) of social media.

**24 - Discussion.**

**26 - Public vs Private.**  Rounding out Section II of Fuchs' text we'll look at chapters 7 & 8 while considering just what the public and the private are in terms of social media.

**28 - Discussion.**

**31 - Class selected subtopic.**


##### November

**2 - Discussion.**

**4 - Review.**

**7 - Fall Term Reading Week, No Class.**

**9 - Fall Term Reading Week, No Class.**

**11 - Remebrance Day / Fall Term Reading Week, No Class.**

#### Topic #4 - Critically Reading Video Games

##### November

**14 - Introduction.**  Critical reading of texts and related works is fairly well established and there are good primers on how to do this available (cf. [Ullyot](http://ullyot.ucalgaryblogs.ca/teaching/close-reading/)).  Critically reading video games is newer---and some might argue more multivariate---and so there is writing on it but the field is still actively developing.  Drawing on two influential gaming studies authors, [Ian Bogost (chapter 1)](http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/eds/detail/detail?sid=95b41b99-5c5c-4de3-a8f5-4c887c9915f6%40sessionmgr105&vid=0&hid=108&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d)) and [Mary Flanagan (chapter 1)](https://www.library.ualberta.ca/catalog/5771496), we'll begin down the path of critically evaluating video games.  Note that this is the second bit of heavy reading since the piece by Bogost on "Procedural Rhetoric" is 60 pages).

**16 - TBD (Possibly, _Can There Be A Feminist War Game?_, drawing on Saklofske's 2016 DHSI presentation by the same title)**

**18 - Discussion.**

**21 - TBD (Possibly, _Is Gamification Bullshit?_, drawing on [_Gamification is Bullshit_](http://bogost.com/writing/blog/gamification_is_bullshit/)**

**23 - Discussion.**

**25 - Whole-Class Game Analysis.**  Based on the content of the previous classes we'll be looking to choose a game that the entire class can participate in critiquing during the following class.  The only requirement is that the game must be generally accessible to everyone in the class.

**28 - Discussion.**

**30 - Class selected subtopic.**

##### December

**2 - Discussion.**

**5 - Review.**

#### Topic #5 - Review
