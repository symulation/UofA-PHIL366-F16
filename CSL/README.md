##CSL Information

**What is Community Service-Learning (CSL)?**  For a quick overview see the summary  in this folder: [what-is-csl-handout2016.pdf](what-is-csl-handout2016.pdf).

##Steps for a Successful CSL Experience

**Step 1 - Choose your placement.** There is only one placement for this class and that is with the [Edmonton Public Library Makerspace](http://www.epl.ca/browse_program/makerspace/).  You can read more about this placement on the [CSL Portal](https://apps.arts.ualberta.ca/csl/Account/LogOn?ReturnUrl=%2fcsl). 

**Step 2 - Review the Student Placement Process.**  In this class the placement process is straightforward because we have just one partner.  All an interested student needed to do (as outlined in [the course syllabus](../366f16-syllabus.pdf)) was email the instructor before 11am on Monday, September 12.

**Step 3 - Confirm your placement with your instructor.**  If you have not received a response to your email then you are not confirmed.  If you have received a response then you are.

**Step 4 - Read the Student Guidebook.**  You can find a copy of this document in this folder as well: [csl-student-guidebook-2016.pdf](csl-student-guidebook-2016.pdf).

**Step 5 - Sign up for your placement by September 21 (CSL Registration Deadline).**  This is done via the [CSL Student Placement Site](https://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/csl-student-site/).  Make sure that you fill in this form or you will slip through the administrative cracks.

**Step 6 - If required, bring 2 pieces of ID to the CSL Office to complete Security Checks between September 14 and 21.**  This is *not* required for the EPL placement in this class.
	
**Step 7 - Schedule a meeting with your community partner supervisor ASAP to begin your placement. Remember to discuss: a timeline, a communication plan, and any deliverables.**  This is in part what the [Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/poll/4ynpta93g5fwds6r) and the additional instructions that accompanied it was in part for.  Remember that your obligations are to facilitate 2-3 sessions with youth at the EPL Makerspace at the start of the term *and then* to continue working with the EPL Makerspace to deliver new activity plans (or the like) to help make use of the technology they have available.  You also need to do things like write reflections over the course of the placement (see [the course syllabus](../366f16-syllabus.pdf)).

**Step 7 1/2 - Check in with your partner regularly.**  This is easily forgotten.  Don't forget it.

**Step 8 - When you're finished your placement, fill out the Student Completion Form *together with your community partner*.** You can find a copy of this document in this folder as well: [studentcompletionformfall-2016.pdf](studentcompletionformfall-2016.pdf)

**Step 9 - Submit your Student Completion Form *to your instructor* before the last day of classes.**
